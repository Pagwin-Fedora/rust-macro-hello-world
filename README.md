# a proc macro hello world
a simple hello world for an attribute proc macro because why not.

okay well technically it's not a hello world but practically it is, it just makes a variable at the top of a function's body which hold's the pre-processed function's definition(5059119bd9e5e01bc467ccf9d5f87ab71300731f)

now it's doing stuff before and after the stuff in the function body
